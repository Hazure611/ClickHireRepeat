    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Hi, Iâ€™m Sheila Marie De Guzman â€” a customer support specialist, account coordinator, and creative thinker with years of experience helping businesses run smoothly, connect with their audience, and improve systems from the inside out.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      My background is in hospitality management, and although I wasnâ€™t able to complete my degree due to life circumstances, Iâ€™ve built a career grounded in people skills, problem-solving, and persistence. Real-world experience became my teacher â€” and I learned quickly.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      I've worked across support channels (phone, chat, email), collaborated with e-commerce teams, and handled tools like Zendesk, Shopify, WordPress, Salesforce, and more. I'm organized, adaptable, and not afraid of technical challenges â€” I face them head-on (with a playlist, of course).
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      I'm currently on the job market, not just looking for any role, but for the right one â€” a place where I can contribute meaningfully, grow professionally, and work alongside people who value clarity, empathy, and getting things done.
    </p>

    <hr class="my-10 border-gray-700" />

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">ðŸ“š Also known as: Hazure Vale</h3>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Outside of work, I write under the name <strong>Hazure Vale</strong>, where I explore themes like identity, rebellion, and survival through fiction. Iâ€™m currently working on a series called <em>Room Zer0</em> â€” a genre-bending story that blends speculative fiction, found family, and moral grayness. (And no, itâ€™s not fanfic â€” though I do love a good AU.)
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Writing helps me stay curious, thoughtful, and observant â€” all qualities I bring into my work, especially when handling support tickets, building knowledge bases, or making things make sense for both users and teams.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 italic mt-10">
      Whether you call me Sheila or Hazure â€” Iâ€™m here to solve problems, tell stories, and make things work better for everyone involved.
    </p>
