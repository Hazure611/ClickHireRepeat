    <h1>Hazure the Writer Saga</h1>
    <p class="saga-intro">Dark tales, raw truths, and a rebellion written in ink and fire.</p>

    <p>Writer. Chaos Connoisseur. Keeper of dark secrets and even darker desires.</p>

    <h2>My Style</h2>
    <p>
      Expect the unexpected. My words blur lines — between light and shadow, innocence and rebellion, love and destruction.
      I dive headfirst into themes of <span class="highlight">identity</span>, <span class="highlight">survival</span>, and the <span class="highlight">grey areas</span> where most stories fear to tread.
    </p>

      "This isn’t just storytelling — it’s a damn rebellion. A raw, unfiltered scream into the void."

        <h3>Crimson Confession</h3>
        <p class="italic">Some sins want to be seen.</p>
        <p>
          In the neon-lit underworld of Tokyo, Echo Onigahara—a jazz singer haunted by silence and past sins—is drawn into Crimson Confession, a darkweb confession app designed for anonymity, voyeurism, and emotional exposure. It's supposed to be a place for unspoken truths. But Echo's truth is about to be rewritten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind the curtain of coded desire lurks Surei, a faceless, obsessive puppetmaster with an agenda that’s anything but random. Each message he sends. Each dare he proposes. Each Room she unlocks. It all leads her deeper into a ritual of unmaking—where confessions are currency, and craving is weaponized.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Echo descends, pleasure tangles with punishment, dominance with devotion, and her sense of self begins to blur. She came to be witnessed. But now, she’s being claimed. And the most dangerous part? She doesn’t want to leave.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
          Crimson Confession is a psychological erotic thriller steeped in digital seduction, sacrificial identity, and the unholy hunger to be known too intimately. There is no safe word here—only the echo of your own desire asking: What will you give up to feel real again?
        </p>

        <h3>Obsidian Code</h3>
        <p class="italic">Beneath the neon haze of a city that never sleeps, loyalty is currency—and betrayal is an art.</p>
        <p>
          Kairo Mori is a man torn between two empires: the ruthless syndicate he was born to serve, and the enigmatic woman who haunts his nights. Kitty Hazami runs a quiet garage at the edge of the city. But under the grease and grit lies something far more dangerous—secrets sharp enough to dismantle legacies.
        </p>
        <p>
          When whispers of a shadow operation known as Obsidian Halo begin to surface, alliances crack, blood runs colder, and one name rises through the silence: Nocturne.
        </p>
        <p>
          As love and power collide, truth becomes a weapon—and everyone has something to hide.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
          The Obsidian Code is a slow-burn descent into obsession, betrayal, and the quiet unraveling of monsters who once believed they were untouchable.
